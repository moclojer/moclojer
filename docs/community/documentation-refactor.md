# Documentation Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete refactoring of moclojer's documentation structure, transforming it from a technical reference into a comprehensive, user-friendly learning resource inspired by Django's excellent documentation organization.

## Problems Addressed

### Before Refactoring
- **Lack of progressive learning path** - No clear journey from beginner to advanced
